This is a Java application that uses the Processing framework and the LabKey API in order to connect to the Immune Tolerance Network TrialShare clinical trials portal.

After receiving the data from TrialShare, this program will display points in a navigable 3D format.  You will also be able to hover over points and see specific participant information regarding that point.  You can also export images of any given view.

The data and view in this application is based on Figure 4 of the JCI 2010 B-Cell Signature manuscript which was created by Zhong Gao.

This is not intended to be a complete end-user ready application.  Instead, it is intended for developers in order to share with them the possibilities of using TrialShare clinical trials data in ways other than those available through the UI.

The data and application itself are intended for demonstration purposes only and should not be used as the basis of scientific investigation without verifying and cross-checking data against the actual publications.  Please refer to TrialShare's FACTOR ITN507ST:  Investigations of Tolerant Kidney Transplant Recipients which can be found at https://www.itntrialshare.org.  You will need to self-register for a free account.
